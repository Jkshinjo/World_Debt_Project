## By Jediah Kai Shinjo Mattison



# Introduction 
In the world today many countries with the highest GDP are often the ones who accumilate the most debt overall. Countries take on debt to support the economy in various ways. A countries national debt is owed by each of their citizens as debt per capita. This project is part of Datacamps SQL project line and goes into a world debt dataset. 



# Project Focus
The goal of this project is to see which country has the highest overall debt and the highest debt per capita. 

# Getting Started 
This project is part of Datacamps curriculum to practice using various SQL funtions such as aggregations, joins, filtering and grouping. The data can be found here [International Debt Indicators] (https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search?fq=(lineage%2Fharvest_system%20eq%20%27INDICATOR%27)&q=international%20debt&sort=&start=0). This data goes into the various indicators of debt from high, middle and low income countries. Datacamp uses Jupyter notebooks to run a SQL shell

# Analysis and Conclusion
Going through the data led to some very shocking conclusions. First, there are many specific types of debt that a country can go into. According to the data, there are 25 distinct types of debt categories a country can accumulate. At the time of analysis, the entire world is in over 30.7 trillion USD in debt with the country with the highest debt being China at over 2.85 trillion and Brazil second at 2.8 trillion. The debt category that has the highest worldwide average is the "DT.AMT.DLXF.CD" type. This is classified as "Principal repayments on external debt, long-term".
